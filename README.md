SALES ANALYSIS, CUSTOMER SEGMENTATION, CROSS-SALE PRODUCT USING ADVENTUREWORKS DATASET

Welcome to the repository of the Sales Analysis, Customer Segmentation, and Cross-Sale Product project using the Adventureworks dataset! This project focuses on analyzing sales data, customer segmentation, and cross-selling products using Power BI to process and visualize the data.

OVERALL OBJECTIVE

This project aims to analyze sales data, customer segmentation, and cross-selling products to gain a deeper understanding of customer preferences, popular products, monthly and yearly sales trends, etc. By combining DAX functions to extract and transform data with Power BI for visualization, we present meaningful insights to stakeholders.

PROBLEM STATEMENT:

We want to analyze key metrics for our sales data to better understand our business performance. Our objectives are to examine the following:

OVERVIEW REPORT PAGE
Total Revenue Year-Over-Year (YOY):

Identify the growth in total revenue year by year.

Total Transactions Year-Over-Year:

Identify the growth in total transactions year by year.

Total Revenue by Country:

Determine the total revenue for each country.

Total Transactions:

Determine the total number of transactions for all products.

Total Transactions by Month, Quarter, and Year:

Determine the total number of transactions by each month, quarter, and year.

Total Revenue by categoryname, subcategoryname, and productname:

Total revenue by product category, product subcategory, and product name.

CUSTOMER SEGMENTATION REPORT PAGE
Number of Customers in Each Segment:

Understand the customer composition to allocate resources effectively.

Which Segments Contribute to 80% of Revenue:

According to the Pareto principle (80-20), approximately 80% of revenue typically comes from 20% of customers or specific customer segments. This helps in identifying strategies and optimizing marketing costs.

Customer Segment of Each Customer:

Evaluate the value of each customer.

What Percentage of Total Revenue is Brought by the Top 20% Best Customers:

According to the Pareto principle, usually only about 20% of the best customers (typically those with high RFM scores) contribute around 80% of the total revenue. Identify important customers and optimize revenue.

CROSS-SALE PRODUCT REPORT PAGE
Productname (Primary Product Name):

Represents the name of the main product that the customer has purchased.

Productname2 (Cross-Sale Product Name):

Represents the name of the product suggested for cross-selling when the customer purchases or views the primary product (productname). This is a complementary or related product that the customer might need additionally.

These analyses and visuals will provide valuable detailed information about the sales data from the Adventureworks dataset, helping to make informed business decisions.
